# Discord OAuth demo

OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted authorization protocol that allows applications to access resources hosted by other web
apps on behalf of users without needing their credentials.

## Purpose of ThisÂ Blog

I want to create an application where users can interact with a custom Discord bot and other resources using OAuth 2.0.
This way, we avoid storing sensitive data, such as passwords, on our servers. By leveraging OAuth 2.0, the application
will rely on Discord's secure authorization mechanism, ensuring that user credentials (username, password) are never
handled directly by our application.
